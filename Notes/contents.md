## Pt. 3: Inference

This covers three techniques we can use when we have models which are intractable to perform inference in and we want to combine assumptions with data:

1. [Laplace Approximation](inference/laplace.pdf)
2. [Sampling](inference/sampling.pdf)
3. [Variational Inference](inference/variational.pdf)
